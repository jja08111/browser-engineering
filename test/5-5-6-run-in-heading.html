<h6>The run-in-heading example</h6>
Run-ins. A “run-in heading” is a heading that is drawn as part of the next paragraph’s text.
The exercise names in this section could be considered run-in headings.
But since browser support for the display: run-in property is poor, this book actually doesn’t use it;
the headings are actually embedded in the next paragraph.
Modify your browser to render h6 elements as run-in headings.
You’ll need to implement the previous exercise on anonymous block boxes,
and then add a special case for h6 elements.
